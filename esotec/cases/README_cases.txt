
Sample cases
------------

These cases represent three variations on the DStestR2.case in runs/runs-multi. 

FatDuct-Single.case:  single rotor, no stator.
FatDuct-Stat2.case:  single rotor plus stator.
FatDuct-CR2.case:  counter-rotating rotors. 

Each case uses the same duct/centerbody geometry, rpm, blade CL and airfoil sections. The single rotors have 6 blades while each CR rotor has 3. Each case is run at Vinf=0, with design B*Gam adjusted to absorb the same power in each case. You will note that (in this case) stators and counter-rotation are equally effective at extracting energy from the swirling flow, while the single rotor case produces about 10% less thrust with the same power.

Two (very similar) airfoil sections are defined for each disk in order to provide users with a full experience of AERO.
