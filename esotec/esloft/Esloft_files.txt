Three ESLOFT files are provided:

ARADfamily.esloft
MHfamily.esloft
TP2family.esloft

These parent airfoil sets are provided as examples of widely varying airfoil designs. They are not necessarily endorsed or recommended. Select parent airfoils suited to your particular blade design, Reynolds, Mach, etc. 

Zero-lift alpha data for each section is from XFOIL at Re 1e6, Mach 0, Ncr 9.


ARA-D Family	t/c %
---------------------
ARA-D-20  	20
ARA-D-13        13
ARA-D-10        10
ARA-D-6         6

These sections are taken directly from the UUIC airfoil database, without modification. 


MH Family	t/c %
---------------------
MH126mod        25
MH112mod        16.4
MH113mod        14.7
MH114mod        13.1
MH115mod        11.1
MH1167mod       9.4
MH120mod        8.1

These are modified versions of airfoils taken from Martin Hepperle's website. http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/index.html. Since in the real world no airfoil has zero trailing edge thickness (especially propeller airfoils), the sections have been modified accordingly. 

Note that XFOIL predicts considerably higher CLmax for the MH126mod vs MH126, the only difference being trailing edge thickness. Keep this in mind when designing thick airfoils. 

Since the MH116 and MH117 have essentially the same thickness, which ESLOFT will not accept, I did the obvious thing and blended them 50:50 to create the MH1167mod. (Sorry, Martin - these are just examples after all.)


TP2 Family	t/c %
---------------------
TP25            25
TP20            20
TP16            16
TP13            13
TP10            10
TP07            7

A conservative, general purpose airfoil set (home brewed). Sections are designed for high turbulence and/or surface contamination, low moments and CDmin, relatively low CLmax. 


Notes on Usage

Upon loading an .esloft file (LSET f), simply delete airfoils (DAF i) that are more than one section outside your desired t/c range. When deleting parents there is no need to save the modified set. An .esloft file is an archive and should remain intact for future requirements. 

Airfoils can be exported (SAF i), edited in XFOIL, then reimported (LAF f), overwriting the original section. Hence an airfoil set can be developed over time and reused over and again. 

Don't forget that AERO settings should be set to reflect your chosen sections (though A0 can be left at zero if desired). 

ESLOFT is a place where ducted fan designer meets airfoil designer. Enjoy!
