
    Typical DFDC session on input file sample1.case
 
    This text shows keyboard inputs.

    All commands can be in lowercase.

    Blank lines below are for clarity.  They are NOT Returns!

    Indentation in the command listing below indicates 
    the menu level to help navigation.



    Start DFDC with an input-file argument, such as the sample1.case input case file:

      % cd runs
      % ../bin/dfdc sample1.case      (giving the full filename is required)

     There will be lots of input echo beginning with sections of the input case data
     followed by information on the elements (centerbody and duct airfoils). You should
     see something like this at a prompt:

 =========================================================
 
  QUIT   Exit program
 
  LOAD f Read ducted fan case from file
  SAVE f Write current ducted fan case to file
 
 .OPER   Direct operating point(s)
 .GDES   Geometry design facility
 .QDES   Mixed-inverse design facility
 
  PANE   Regenerate paneled geometry from buffer geometry
 .PPAR   Show/change paneling
  PCOP   Copy buffer geometry directly into paneling
  PWRT f Write paneling parameters to disk file
  PGET f Get paneling parameters from disk file
 
 .PLOP   Plotting options
  NAME s Change case name
 
 DFDC   c>

      You type commands at the prompt to initiate actions.  Try this...

OPER       enter operating menu
cpx        plot unconverged case with geometry and wake grid

exec       execute case and converge operating point

      At this point you should see a plot of the duct (below) and the pressures (Cp)
      on the duct walls and wakes.  The case corresponds to an actuator disk with 
      specified circulation (BGAM=10, corresponding to roughly 200N total thrust).
      The orange line is the pressure on the duct (note the jump at the axial station 
      for the rotor).  The red line is the pressures on the centerbody.  
      The downstream orange and green lines show the wake pressures 
      (note how the pressures on the centerbody are lower (-Cp's) than on the duct wake).

vref 75    this changes the reference velocity (for the Cp's), changes display only.

pvel       this displays the rotor velocities in absolute frame and blade relative frame
    
vinf 50    this changes the freestream inflow to 50m/s

exec       execute case and converge operating point, note how duct thrust drops

vinf 0

exec       get back to hover condition

plot 3     show the radial distribution of circulation (summary plot w. forces)

force      show table of forces on problem elements (element 1 and 2 are CB and duct)

desi       design a rotor blade for this flow condition and loading (BGAM=10)

plot 2     show the disk outline from axial view

plot 1     show the blade shape in 3-views

exec       execute case with specified rotor

plot 3     show blade data

CL 1.2 0.8 set design CL for new blade 

desi       design new blade to higher CL

plot 2     show the blade

hard       make postscript plot to file plot.ps

vinf 10    set axial freestream to 10m/s
exec       converge case with rotor at 10m/s (note lower duct thrust)

plot 3     show blade operating point
hard       make postscript plot to file plot.ps

  <Return>   return to main DFDC menu

save myrotor.case   save current case with rotor design

quit        end DFDC session and close plot file
