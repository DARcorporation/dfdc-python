
    Typical DFDC session on input file sample2.case
 
    This text shows keyboard inputs.

    All commands can be in lowercase.

    Blank lines below are for clarity.  They are NOT Returns!

    Indentation in the command listing below indicates 
    the menu level to help navigation.



    Start DFDC with an input-file argument, such as the sample2.case input case file:

      % cd runs
      % ../bin/dfdc sample2.case      (giving the full filename is required)

     There will be lots of input echo beginning with sections of the input case data
     followed by information on the elements (centerbody and duct airfoils). You should
     this at a prompt:

 =========================================================
 
  QUIT   Exit program
 
  LOAD f Read ducted fan case from file
  SAVE f Write current ducted fan case to file
 
 .OPER   Direct operating point(s)
 .GDES   Geometry design facility
 .QDES   Mixed-inverse design facility
 
  PANE   Regenerate paneled geometry from buffer geometry
 .PPAR   Show/change paneling
  PCOP   Copy buffer geometry directly into paneling
  PWRT f Write paneling parameters to disk file
  PGET f Get paneling parameters from disk file
 
 .PLOP   Plotting options
  NAME s Change case name
 
 DFDC   c>

      You type commands at the prompt to initiate actions.  Try this...

OPER       enter operating menu
exec       execute case and converge operating point

      At this point you should see a plot of the duct (tilted at 3deg to the axial 
      direction) and the wall pressures (Cp) on the duct and wakes.  

      This case corresponds to an actuator disk with 200N of total thrust (specified 
      by a circulation (BGAM=11.17). 

      Lets look at Vinf=0,10,20,40 m/s freestream conditions and plot each

hard       first make a hardcopy plot of Vinf=0 condition

vinf 10    set 10m/s freestream
e          converge operating point (note shorthand for exec)
hard       plot it!
vinf 20    set 20m/s freestream
e          converge operating point
hard       plot it!
v    40    set 40m/s freestream (note shorthand for vinf)
exec       converge operating point (low duct thrust)
hard       plot it!

vinf 0    back to 0m/s


  <Return>   return to main DFDC menu

GDES       enter geometric design menu

      You should see the two duct foil elements (1 is the CB, 2 is the duct). Lets
      scale up the CB and then de-rotate the duct walls by 1.5deg.

1          set element #1 as design target

scale 1.25 rescale X and Y by same factor 

2          set element #2 as design target

ref 
TE         set reference point for rotation to near TE

adeg -1.5  rotate by 1.5deg nose down

exec       execute geometric changes to buffer airfoils to use them for analysis

  <Return>   return to main DFDC menu

OPER       enter operating menu
exec       execute case and converge operating point

hard       plot it!

      Lets look at Vinf=10,20,40 m/s freestream conditions and plot each

vinf 10    set 10m/s freestream
e          converge operating point (note shorthand for exec)
hard       plot it!
vinf 20    set 20m/s freestream
e          converge operating point
hard       plot it!
v    40    set 40m/s freestream (note shorthand for vinf)
exec       converge operating point (low duct thrust)
hard       plot it!

vinf 0    back to 0m/s

bgam 15    set circulation (to give approx 220N thrust)

desi       design a rotor
plot 2     show blades (big chords!)

nblds 7    need more blades to cut chord
desi
plot 2     that's more like it...
hard       save plot

  <Return>   return to main DFDC menu

save myrotor2.case   save current case with rotor design

quit        end DFDC session and close plot file
