
    Typical DFDC session on input file sample3.case (a rotor + stator case)
    This case has a rotor defined as blades and a stator defined as an actuator disk.
 
    This text shows keyboard inputs.

    All commands can be in lowercase.

    Blank lines below are for clarity.  They are NOT Returns!

    Indentation in the command listing below indicates 
    the menu level to help navigation.



    Start DFDC with an input-file argument, such as the sample3g.case input case file:

      % cd runs
      % ../bin/dfdc sample3.case      (giving the full filename is required)

     There will be lots of input echo beginning with sections of the input case data
     followed by information on the elements (centerbody and duct airfoils). You should
     this at a prompt:

 =========================================================
 
  QUIT   Exit program
 
  LOAD f Read ducted fan case from file
  SAVE f Write current ducted fan case to file
 
 .OPER   Direct operating point(s)
 .GDES   Geometry design facility
 .QDES   Mixed-inverse design facility
 
  PANE   Regenerate paneled geometry from buffer geometry
 .PPAR   Show/change paneling
  PCOP   Copy buffer geometry directly into paneling
  PWRT f Write paneling parameters to disk file
  PGET f Get paneling parameters from disk file
 
 .PLOP   Plotting options
  NAME s Change case name
 
 DFDC   c>

      You type commands at the prompt to initiate actions.  Try this...

OPER       enter operating menu
xy         show geometry of duct and disks

exec       execute case and converge operating point

      At this point you should see a plot of the duct and centerbody with rotor 
      (bladed rotor) outlined with LE/TE lines, and stator (actuator disk w/o LE/TE
      line)

cpx   display the Cp's vs x on duct + force summary

      This case corresponds to a rotor/stator with ~240N of total thrust (specified 
      by a circulation (BGAM~= +10 on rotor, -10 on stator). Note the white circle at the 
      TE (this is the stagnation point!)

      This is a static hover case, lets try tracing some streamlines on the plot...

slc
b     with cursor on plot of duct, hit "b" key to trace both upstream/downstream 
u     hit "u" to trace upstream only 
d     hit "d" to trace downstream only
.
q     hit "q" key when you want to stop

Lets try the same at Vinf=20

vinf 20
e          converge the 20m/s case

slc   trace some more streamlines, watch the difference, look for stag. point 
b     with cursor on plot of duct, hit "b" key to trace both upstream/downstream 
b     try several...
.
q     hit "q" key when you want to stop

hard       make hardcopy with streamlines

cpx        back to the normal Cp,x plot

Lets look at the rotor blading

plot 2     shows axial view of rotor
plot 3     show blade CL,GAM,Mach for rotor

Now, lets design a stator blading

2          set disk #2 as working disk, should see OPERi(2) as prompt
desi       design blades for stator
cpx        show side view, big chords on that stator!
plot 2     axial view of stator (no camber shown, looks like zero-lift direction near axial)
show       get dump of blade params, including solidity (over 1.3 at hub)

nbld 9     set blade count to 9
cl 0.7     set stator CL=0.7 
desi       redesign stator to same circulation, new blade count and CL
cpx        show side view of blading
show       get dump of blade params, lower solidity (~0.85 at hub)
plot 3     show blade CL,GAM,Mach for stator

Now lets do a BL analysis on the duct walls

bl         get into BL submenu
bl         do BL analysis using current (free) transition
plot       plot BL data, shows Q velocity on walls
o          change ordinate for plot
h          to BL shape factor
           hit return to get back to BL submenu
tr         set transition points for turbulent flow
.02 .02    set transition to near LE
bl         run new BL analysis
plot       plot BL shape factor, different!
           hit return to get out of plot
           hit return to get out of BL submenu

forces     check forces on duct and centerbody (including viscous)

  <Return>   return to main DFDC menu

quit        end DFDC session and close plot file
